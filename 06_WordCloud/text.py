text = "To comprehensively evaluate model performance across all datasets and models, several key metrics are considered. Accuracy measures the overall classification performance, both as an average across datasets and individually per dataset. Precision and recall provide class-specific insights, highlighting how well each model identifies true positives and avoids false positives or negatives, again reported both per dataset and on average. The F1-score, as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offers a balanced performance metric. A confusion matrix is generated for each model and dataset to detail class-wise prediction outcomes, with representative examples highlighted. The classification report further expands on this by providing a detailed summary of precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. To monitor learning progress, training loss and accuracy are logged during training for each model on each dataset, accompanied by representative curves. Similarly, validation loss and accuracy are tracked to evaluate generalization ability and detect overfitting, also visualized through representative learning curves. Figure 9 (if included) is intended to provide a comparative overview of these performance metrics, either as averaged values or representative results across datasets.  Efficiency metrics are also evaluated to determine the suitability of each model for mobile deployment. Inference time, representing the average processing time per image in milliseconds, is measured on a CPU using a batch size of 1 to simulate real-time mobile scenarios. Model size, expressed in megabytes (MB), is recorded for each trained model to assess storage requirements. Lastly, the number of trainable parameters is calculated for each architecture, providing insights into the model's computational complexity."
